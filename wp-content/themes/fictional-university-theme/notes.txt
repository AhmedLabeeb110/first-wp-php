How to check JS posts and pages JSON data:

10 most recent posts: http://fictional-university.local/wp-json/wp/v2/posts

10 most recent pages: http://fictional-university.local/wp-json/wp/v2/pages

For example, if you want to check the two most recent posts: 

http://fictional-university.local/wp-json/wp/v2/posts?per_page=2

If you know the ID of the post that you want to show:

http://fictional-university.local/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/7

If you want to search something based on strings(the word search after the question mark can be named as preferred):

http://fictional-university.local/wp-json/wp/v2/posts?search=searchstring

This is how you can access/load/search all the pages and the posts of a website based on search terms

http://fictional-university.local/?s=searchterm

This is how we can access the ten most recent custom posts:

http://fictional-university.local/wp-json/wp/v2/customPostName

If you know the ID of the post that you want to show:

http://fictional-university.local/wp-json/wp/v2/custoPostName/postId

Important Note:

do_action creates an action hook, add_action executes hooked functions when that hook is called
